Repository will only have two main branches, develop, containing the latest working code, and main containing the current release.

To add code, start a new branch and then issue a pull request to add features into the develop branch, or fork the repository and sync code back in to the develop branch.

Naming examples:

dev-feature-admincreate
dev-bugfix-complete_button
